//You're a regional manager for an office beverage sales company, and right now you're in charge of paying your sales team they're monthly commissions.
//
//Sales people get paid using the following formula for the total commission: commission is 6.2% of profit, with no commission for any product to total less than zero.
//
//Input Description
//You'll be given two matrices showing the sales figure per salesperson for each product they sold, and the expenses by product per salesperson. Example:
//
//Revenue
//
//         Frank   Jane
//Tea       120    145
//Coffee    243    265
//
//Expenses
//
//         Frank   Jane
//Tea       130     59
//Coffee    143    198

//Output Description
//Your program should calculate the commission for each salesperson for the month. Example:
//
//                Frank   Jane
//Commission       6.20   9.49
